# Number-Plate-Recognition
This is my mini-project where i use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to recognize the numbers in a typical number plate. 
This includes the detection of number plate from the car first and then extracting it. Then using OCR, the numbers are recognized and then
stored in the database. This is initial stage project. Further development includes integration with hardware devices and using Machine 
Learning model to recognize characters in the plate rather than just using OCR.
